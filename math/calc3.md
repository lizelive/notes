stokes but 2d
relates a line integral around a simple closed curve C to a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C

# stokes

The line integral of a vector field over a loop is equal to the flux of its curl through the enclosed surface.


# curl
The curl at a point in the field is represented by a vector whose length and direction denote the magnitude and axis of the maximum circulation.[


# Divergenct

# Divergence theorem
the sum of all sources of the field in a region (with sinks regarded as negative sources) gives the net flux out of the region

# Gradient
direction and rate of fastest increase

# Jacobian matrix
like the derivitieves of all the vaues in all the diemensions

# total derivative
 Unlike partial derivatives, the total derivative approximates the function with respect to all of its arguments, not just a single one. In many situations, this is the same as considering all partial derivatives simultaneously. 


the total derivative of {\displaystyle f}f is the linear transformation corresponding to the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives at that point.

# Riemannian manifold
a real, smooth manifold M equipped with a positive-definite inner product gp on the tangent space TpM at each point p


# analytic
locally equal to its own Taylor series (analytic).

# Holomorphic function
strong requirements on complex function
requires analatic and a lot of other thins



# Hypercomplex number

# Pauli matrices
rotations 

# Clifford algebras
Let A be a real associative algebra with unit element 1. Then

any two-dimensional subalgebra generated by an element e0 of A such that e02 = −1 is isomorphic to C (algebra of complex numbers),
any two-dimensional subalgebra generated by an element e0 of A such that e02 = 1 is isomorphic to R2 (pairs of real numbers with component-wise product, isomorphic to the algebra of split-complex numbers),
any four-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set {e0, e1} of mutually anti-commuting elements of A such that {\displaystyle e_{0}^{2}=e_{1}^{2}=-1}e_0 ^2 = e_1 ^2 = -1 is isomorphic to H (algebra of quaternions),
any four-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set {e0, e1} of mutually anti-commuting elements of A such that {\displaystyle e_{0}^{2}=e_{1}^{2}=1}e_0 ^2 = e_1 ^2 = 1 is isomorphic to M2(R) (2 × 2 real matrices, coquaternions),
any eight-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set {e0, e1, e2} of mutually anti-commuting elements of A such that {\displaystyle e_{0}^{2}=e_{1}^{2}=e_{2}^{2}=-1}e_0 ^2 = e_1 ^2 = e_2 ^2 = -1 is isomorphic to 2H (split-biquaternions),
any eight-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set {e0, e1, e2} of mutually anti-commuting elements of A such that {\displaystyle e_{0}^{2}=e_{1}^{2}=e_{2}^{2}=1}e_0 ^2 = e_1 ^2 = e_2 ^2 = 1 is isomorphic to M2(C) (2 × 2 complex matrices, biquaternions, Pauli algebra).
