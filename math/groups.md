# Abelian Group
a group where element compute $A B = B A$

means it has  symmetric multiplication tables.

All cyclic groups are Abelian.

# magma, binary algebraic structure, 

unital if it has a neutral element 1, hence an element 1∈S in that 1⋅x=x=x⋅1;

(Some authors mean by ‘magma’ what we call a unital magma (cf. Borceux-Bourn Def. 1.2.1). One can consider one-sided unital elements separately: 1L⋅x=x and/or x=x⋅1R. Units may be far from unique.)

commutative if the binary operation takes the same value when its two arguments are interchanged: x⋅y=y⋅x;

associative if the binary operation satisfies the associativity condition (x⋅y)⋅z=x⋅(y⋅z);

invertible if it has an inverse element.

an absorption magma if it has an element 0∈S such that the binary opetation satisfies the absorption condition: 0⋅x=x⋅0=0;

a quasigroup if one-sided multiplication by any element is a bijection.

# Equivalence Relation
"xRy" to mean (x,y) is an element of R, and we say "x is related to y,"


# H-Space

# Homotopy
a transfomration between two things (like functions)

f, g from space X to space Y has homotophy continous map G(x, 1) = g(x) and G(x, 0)=f(x)

# map
unique object of every object in set
one-to-one

# function
a many-to-one asocation 

# Topological Space

it's a set X with collection of subsets (open or closed have slightly diffrent conditions) such that

0 and X are in T
T is closed on union and intersection

# what am i trying to do?

predict stuff
handle similarities
(or at least mantain angles)

# Represetation



maybe eigen vectors?

I want cyclic (sometimes)

Or exponental [0, inf]

can be rings, sometimes indepentent

# Bloch sphere
In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.[1]


maybe spherical harmonics + riemann sphere

# Riemann sphere


just a way of thinking about the extended complex numbers is really good.
I wonder what happens if i use hyper complex numbers?

# Fubini–Study metric. The mapping from the unit 3-sphere in the two-dimensional state space {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{2}}\mathbb{C}^2 to the Bloch sphere is the

# Hopf fibration, with each ray of spinors mapping to one point on the Bloch sphere.11

# Projective Hilbert space
is scale independent hiblert space

# hilbert space
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space
a vector space equipped with an inner product which defines a distance function for which it is a complete metric space.

# diffeomorphic
for smooth manifolds, isomorphism, bijection differentiable manifold to another. both the function and its inverse are differentiable.
