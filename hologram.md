# Computer-generated holography
cgh

# End-to-end learning of 3D phase-only holograms for holographic display

new paper for 2022, can use cnn to create cgh
they say limit 5 layers, but resnets


# spatial light modulators
(slm)
example is like an lcd
phase and/or amplitude

# Angular spectrum method
fft

# Huygens–Fresnel principle
every point on a wavefront is itself the source of spherical wavelets, and the secondary wavelets emanating from different points mutually interfere.

# time-harmonic
viberates with time

# Surface equivalence principle


Kirchhoff's diffraction formula
The Huygens–Fresnel principle is derived by the Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction formula.
